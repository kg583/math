Hello! My name is KG, and I am 2nd-year PhD candidate in mathematics at the University of Virginia, working under [Ken Ono](https://uva.theopenscholar.com/ken-ono). I am interested in number theory, primarily integer partitions and modular forms.

Here you can find information on my academic ventures, including my [publications](https://kg583.github.io/math/papers/) and [teaching experience](https://kg583.github.io/math/teaching/). I also write a lot of code; research projects can be found [here](https://github.com/kg583/sagemath-projects), with everything else on my primary GitHub page.
